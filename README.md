### Dradis Docker Container

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image with [Dradis-CE](http://dradisframework.org/).

This is a fork of [zuazo/dradis-docker](https://github.com/zuazo/dradis-docker), updating it to use the active dradis-ce repo.

This also has an `arch`-branch for an Arch Linux based image, which is more of an artifact of trying to fix an issue building on a grsecurity host (still doesn't work) than a recommended image as there's currently no reasonably minimal arch base image available, making it quite large.

### Supported Tags and Respective `Dockerfile` Links

* `latest` ([*/Dockerfile*](https://github.com/zuazo/dradis-docker/tree/master/Dockerfile))

#### What Is Dradis?

From [its own website](http://dradisframework.org/):

*The Dradis Framework is an open-source collaboration and reporting platform for IT security experts.*

*Dradis is a self-contained web application that provides a centralized repository of information to keep track of everything that has been done so far, and what is still ahead.*

#### How to Use This Image

##### Build

$ git clone https://github.com/evait/dradis-docker-ce
$ cd dradis-docker-ce
$ docker build -t evait/dradis-ce .

##### Create a Directory to Store the Database Data

    $ mkdir -p dbdata/

##### Setup a Redis instance

    $ docker run --name dradis-redis -d redis:alpine

##### Run Dradis

You need to set the `/dbdata` volume path and link the Redis container:

    $ docker run \
        --publish 3000:3000 \
        --volume "$(pwd)/dbdata:/dbdata" \
        --link dradis-redis:redis \
      evait/dradis-ce

You can now open [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) to access Dradis.

#### Exposed TCP/IP Ports

* `3000`: Dradis application HTTP port.

#### Environment Variables Used at Runtime

* `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Randomized string which is used to verify the integrity of signed cookies (randomly generated by default). See [here](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#config-secrets-yml).

You can change them using `docker run -e [...]` or in your *Dockerfile*, using the `ENV` instruction.

#### Read-only Environment Variables Used at Build Time

* `RAILS_ENV`: Rails environment (`production`).

The docker working directory is set to the main Dradis directory (`/opt/dradis-ce`).
